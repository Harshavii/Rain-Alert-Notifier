# Rain-Alert-Notifier

So in this project, I have used requests, API modules in order to track weather condition.
OpenWeather website is used in this project to get the required weather details.
Basically, api calls from above mentioned website helps to track the weather id codes using latitude and longitude parameters.
Weather id codes determines the weather conditions like rain, drizzle, sunny, etc.
After fetching details, a telegram bot is created to send message alerting about thunderstorm.
